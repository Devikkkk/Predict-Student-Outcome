# Predicting Student Outcomes: From Data Exploration to Model Evaluation

## Overview
This project aims to predict **student outcomes** (Graduate, Dropout, Enrolled) using structured machine learning techniques. The dataset includes student academic records and demographic information. The goal is to explore patterns and build predictive models that can identify students at risk of dropping out.

## Project Goals
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends in student outcomes.
- **Preprocess data** by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and balancing the dataset.
- **Train multiple machine learning models** to predict student outcomes.
- **Evaluate model performance** using classification metrics.

## Dataset Details
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)
- **Target Variable:** Student Outcome (`Graduate`, `Dropout`, `Enrolled`)
- **Features:** Academic performance, attendance, socioeconomic status, demographic details.
